# Database-Systems-Gradebook
In this project, we utilized SQL to create our database, insert data into the database, and perform queries on our Gradebook to get our desired outcomes. 

To test our work, we used an [online compiler](programiz.com).
First, we access [Programiz's Online SQL Editor](https://www.programiz.com/sql/online-compiler/)
Then...
- Copy and paste Gradebook.sql file (Creates Tables)
- Copy and paste Insertion.sql (Inserts Data Into Tables)
- Copy and paste each query one by one (Queries are separated by commas in the 'queries.sql' file)
